                    My oldest hobby, that I've had an unwavering love for is anime and manga, and 
                    I've enjoyed in some way, shape or form since I was 4 years old.
                    Throughout the many tried and failed hobbies, reading manga and watching
                    anime has never gone away. It's a huge part of who I am and has gotten me
                    through many hard times in my life, so it'll always have a place in my heart

                I say 'pets' but I really only have one that's
                actually mine, and that's Eevee. I got her in 2017
                when she was 3 months old, and no words can describe
                how much she has done for me, just by existing and being
                her sassy self. She has saved me by bringing me laughs
                and smiles everyday, and she's my pride and joy

                Besides Eevee, I also regularly see my sister's cat Moon,
                who is flighty, eats a ton, and is super cute and affectionate.
                I also see my partner's cats, Nalla and Lucky, who are two of the 
                most laid back cats I've ever seen in my life
